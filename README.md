Clatter is a set of software libraries for secure, device-to-device communication without using the internet. The purpose of the Clatter project is to create memory-safe implementations of offline networking protocols with clear APIs and documentation to make it easy for developers to add these technologies to their applications. Currently, Clatter includes implementations of three protocols pioneered by the [Serval Project](https://servalproject.org):

* **Mesh Datagram Protocol**
* **Mesh Streaming Protocol**
* **Rhizome**
